## Heating

The flat is completly automated in terms of heating.

- Someone opened a window/door? -> Turn all heating off.
- No ones home? -> Turn all heating off.
- Just arrived at home? -> Wait some time (e.g. for ventilating after arrival) turn heating on.
- Cold? -> Trigger a heating boost for some minutes.
- Night reduction? -> Disable all heating automations between 23:00 and 07:00.
